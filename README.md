# rock-paper-scissor

Welcome to ~~testing~~ learning grounds for Rock Paper Scissor using Javascript by yours truly. Here, I have come again to flex my skills of web development that I just so happened to pick up thanks to TOP. As you are already, this is my **third** project on TOP to demonstrate the skills I *should* have acquired after all the intense training TOP made me go through.

Let us see whether I live up to the expectations or not.

**Note**: *This may feel like I am addressing an audience, and you may consider it a bit childish or foolish, but this is far from that. The audience is not you. The audience is me. Or rather whatever there is in my brain.*
