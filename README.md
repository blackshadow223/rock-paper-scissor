# rock-paper-scissor

Welcome to ~~testing~~ learning grounds for Rock Paper Scissor using Javascript by yours truly. Here, I have come again to flex my skills of web development that I just so happened to pick up thanks to TOP. As you are already aware, this is my **third** project on TOP to demonstrate the skills I *should* have acquired after all the intense training TOP made me go through.

Let us see whether I live up to the expectations or not.

**Note**: *This may feel like I am addressing an audience, and you may consider it a bit childish or foolish, but this is far from that. The audience is not you. The audience is me. Or rather whatever there is in my brain.*

### Time for self-reflection
It was actually too easy. Reason: I have beginner experience in C++ programming. That is why. The only thing that I have the biggest complain with is, again, the number of my git commits (as well as the messages). "Dozen commits and the whole project is done?" Man, this is quite difficult. I also forgot to commit and only realized when I was done with half of the project (due to ADHD). I feel stupid.

**Time for more self-reflection:** Here is the thing, the most difficulty that I had was with the stupid UI. I just didn't know what to do with it. After asking around TOP server, I realized I don't have to push myself, and therefore I settled for a very simple UI.

The other problematic thing I ran into was redirecting input from "Window" object methods to DOM manipulations through Javascript. I just had a hard time figuring out how I could take input from the buttons instead of the already-working Window.prompt methods.

Something I already know is that I will get better as I do more and gain more experience. But there is still a part of me that isn't satisfied with myself doing half-a**ed work :(

In any case, I'll try my best moving forward. I will finish TOP to its last bit.
